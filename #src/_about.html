              One of the Playstation’s biggest game expected to be released on the PlayStation 5 in
              2021 is
              <span class="about__text about__text_white">Horizon Forbidden West</span>, a sequel to
              Guerilla Games' open-world sci-fi game from 2017. Sony Interactive Entertainment has
              continued to pull back the curtain on the long-awaited sequel where Aloy's adventure
              continues. This is everything that you'd want to know about the game, including its
              release window, platforms, and story details.

          Leading up to those colossal announcements, Guerrilla had teased the sequel's existence
          with a handful of mysterious job openings and even a few accidental social media posts.
          But now the title has been confirmed as an early release to show off the technical
          capabilities of the PS5 by continuing Aloy's critically acclaimed storyline.

          <p class="about__text">
            Gamers play as Aloy, a member of one of many warring tribes that stumbles upon the
            origins of the mechanical beasts the rule the world. They were created by a company
            named Faro Automated Solutions, nearly 1,000 ago as “peacemakers,” but need biomass for
            fuel. Eventually, they consumed so much of the Earth’s biosphere that it eradicated most
            humans. But there was a Plan B.
